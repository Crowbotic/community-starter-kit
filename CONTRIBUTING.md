### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Work on developing the code of the app itself.
- **qa-needed**: Willing to test out the app in any way you can. No matter what you think of, test it out.
- **documentation-needed**: Able to explain things clearly as possible for everyone to understand.
- **bug-high-priority**: Fix the bugs that are really getting in the way of this app working perfectly.
- **bug-low-priority**: These are smaller bugs that won't break the app, but are going to cause some smaller issues.
- **help-wanted**: Looking to recruit anyone who might want to help out.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
